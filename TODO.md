## AI

### Bet

- Pre-evaluate other strategies
- Create more naive bots
- Genetic algorithm

### Scotty

- Trapper heuristic (extending path, recalculate)
- Update Scotty based on Heuristic
- Multiple part walls (x2/3 placement?)

### Spaceship

- [X] Use angle to choose direction
- Improve avoidance heuristic
- [X] Improve evaluation heuristic (+direction?)

- More aggressive avoidance at start
- Gravity lowering
- Store dickery, then be dicks ourselves
- [X] Avoidance mechanism
- Backtracking and evaluating strategies
- [X] Iterating *other* bots
- Genetic algorithm
- no repeat!


## Optimization

### Robots

- Stop being lazy and rewrite
- Come up with clever grouping algo?
